This week we have been evaluating models, adding to our dataset and have been working on webcam integration

Dataset adding/creating

This is being done by every group member, and I (Eli) have been doing most of the work cleaning everything up/setting it up for model training.

Currently we have 3GB of photos, which is more than 7000 total split 70/30 for training and validation. The dataset is almost complete, we just need Ryan's photos for it to be as robust as we want for the final model.


Model training/accuracy

This was done mostly by Kyle over the past week or two, and involves training a whole bunch of different models using different methods. In our video there's an image showing the accuracy of each model we have so far (11 total).

We need to choose one as the default option currently, but the models are looking good so far.


Webcam Integration

This is being done by me (Eli) and Emily. Going very well so far. We're using opencv for the integration and it's working like an absolute charm. We currently have it only analyzing one frame every half second, but this may be subject to change in the future once we have a fully working beta version to see if that's too much or too little analyzation.

Setbacks and challenges:

Getting photos together has been strenuous. Internet and communication problems have made it difficult for everyone. I'm mostly doing all the merging of the photos into one neat dataset locally before uploading them to the server we have access to, so it is quite challenging.

Plan for the next 3 weeks:

We just need to fit everything together. The webcam integration is looking like it will go swimmingly, and the models we have should be good enough for basic testing. We should be able to have everything together in a beta version very soon, and then test/tweak it for a while before the final presentation.
